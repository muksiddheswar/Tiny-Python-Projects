# Tiny-Python-Projects
Reinventing the wheel in Python.   

- Web Scraping.
- File Manipulation.
- List Manipulation.
- Clock.



## File Manipulation:
( The idea is to ease manual effort through tiny Python scripts.   )

- Create a list of files in a location.
- Create a list of MP3 files in a specific location.

### Planned Topics
- Check if song metadata (artist, album, title) has special characters.
- Rename mp3 files according to metadata.
- Check if newly downloaded songs are already present in local library.
- Move mp3 files into album specific folders.
- Synch new files in local storage with external storage.

## List Manipulation:
- Find the innermost list in a list of lists.

## Clock:
- Produce beeps in windows.
- Alarm and pomodoro.
